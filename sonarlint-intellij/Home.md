# Welcome to SonarLint for IntelliJ

SonarLint is an IDE extension that helps you detect and fix quality issues as you write code. Like a spell checker, SonarLint squiggles flaws so they can be fixed before committing code.

You can install it directly from the [JetBrains Marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7973-sonarlint) and it will then detect new bugs and quality issues as you code (for Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python and HTML).

SonarLint can optionally be bound to SonarQube or SonarCloud to provide additional features.

SonarLint is also available for [Eclipse](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-eclipse), [Visual Studio](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-visualstudio), [VS Code](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarlint-vscode) (the supported languages vary from IDE to IDE).
