Please visit [https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarlint/eclipse/](https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarlint/eclipse/) to check out the new documentation website. We’ve improved the documentation as a whole, integrated the four SonarLint IDE extension docs together, and moved everything under the sonarsource.com domain to share a home with the SonarQube docs (SonarCloud to come in Q3 of 2023).
