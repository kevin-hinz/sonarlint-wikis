We’ve improved the documentation as a whole, integrated the four SonarLint IDE extension docs together, and moved everything under the sonarsource.com domain to share a home with the SonarQube docs (SonarCloud to come in Q3 of 2023).

# Welcome to SonarLint for VS Code

SonarLint is an IDE extension that helps you detect and fix quality issues as you write code. Like a spell checker, SonarLint squiggles flaws so they can be fixed before committing code.

You can install SonarLint directly from the [VS Code Extensions marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode); it will detect new bugs and quality issues as you code (for Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python and HTML).

SonarLint can optionally be bound to SonarQube or SonarCloud to provide additional features.

SonarLint is also available for IntelliJ IDEA and other Jet Brains IDEs, Visual Studio, and Eclipse (supported languages vary from IDE to IDE).
